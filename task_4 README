This project, completed as part of my AI & ML internship, focuses on building a binary classification model using Logistic Regression with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from Scikit-learn. The workflow includes loading the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, standardizing features, training the Logistic Regression model, and evaluating it using a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score. Visualizations such as the Sigmoid function and ROC curve are generated to better understand model behavior and threshold performance. The project highlights key concepts like feature scaling, probability prediction, threshold tuning, precision–recall trade-offs, and evaluating binary classifiers. Overall, this task demonstrates the complete end-to-end pipeline for logistic regression classification and serves as a practical introduction to binary machine learning models.
