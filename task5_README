For Task 5, I implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest models using the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn.
I trained the Decision Tree classifier, visualized the tree, and analyzed overfitting by limiting the tree depth.
Then I trained and evaluated a Random Forest model and compared its accuracy with the Decision Tree. 
I also interpreted feature importance and performed 5-fold cross-validation for model reliability. 
Random Forest outperformed the single tree, showing better generalization. 
All code, outputs, and the README have been added to my GitHub repository.
